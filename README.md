# todo-api
Simple todo API with node.js backend

This is RESTful API but i also plan to make it useful for a mobile app in future and for now it is deployed on here:

Feel free to request anything.
Current available requests(CRUD operations only) are:
1-Get /todos , Get /todos:id
2-Post /todos
3-Delete /todos:id
4-Patch /todos:id

My special thanks to Andrew Mead(my instructor for being so helpful to students) and Heroku(my cloud platform for being so generous to students)
